# Chingu Voyage 59 - Tier 3 Team #33 — Backlog refinement

**Date:** 30 January 2026  
**Time:** 7:00 PM GMT-5 (Montreal)

**Attendees**
- Kayleigh
- Margaret
- Chris
- Direwen

**Agenda**
- Collect feedback on issues in current sprint (Story detail, estimate accuracy)
- Review user stories that should be done next (list places, delete place, check-in/out dates for lodging, manual itinerary planning)

**Notes**
- Frontend integration is not yet started, blocking the finalization of backend work
- Margaret suggests a profile page where user can edit their info and change their password. Kayleigh will add this to backlog
- Check-in/out dates: we can't rely on the fact the place is a hotel (use case: Airbnb, friend's place). User needs the ability to specify that a given place is a lodging
- Suggested place search + add flow:
    - On map, user searches for place (ex: Eiffel tower)
    - User adds Eiffel tower to unordered list (bucket) of places to see during the trip. No date assigned yet
    - User selects Eiffel tower in bucket in order to assign it to a day manually
    - A small UI element should let the user add check-in/out dates regardless of type of place selected
