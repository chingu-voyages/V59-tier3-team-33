# Chingu Voyage 59 - Tier 3 Team #33 — Sprint 3 Agile ceremonies

**Date:** 9 February 2026  
**Time:** 7:00 PM GMT-5 (Montreal)

**Attendees**
- Kayleigh
- Chanae
- Rob
- Margaret
- Direwen

**Agenda**
1. Sprint review
2. Sprint retrospective
3. Sprint planning

**Notes**
1. Review: 
    - Direwen presented the UI so far: landing page, list of trips, signup, login
    - Trip creation via the UI is not created yet, only via API calls
    - We can't get place images via Mapbox. Can we get opening hours, etc? Direwen not sure, Chris knows
2. Retrospective:
    - No one completed the survey
    - Q: Is the work you're doing right now helping you reach your personal goals for being in this group? Direwen says yes, he learned frontend (React, Next.js)
    - Concerns: not having enough frontend devs
3. Planning:
    - Place display: We can only get name, address, coordinates from Mapbox. Might need to remove other elements from UI
    - Rob: route/daily itinerary optimization is still an issue. An option as this stage would be to pivot and just focus on solving that problem until the end of the voyage
